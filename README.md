# StuckInARut

I successfully solved the "Stuck in a Rut" problem from the [USACO 2020 December Contest - Bronze Division](http://www.usaco.org/index.php) using C++ in preperation for the upcoming USACO contest. The problem involved navigating Farmer John's cows on an infinite 2D grid, optimizing their movements to calculate the grass consumption for each cow. My solution efficiently processed input data, considered cow interactions, and determined the grass eaten by each cow. I also solved the most challenging aspect and edge case in the problem of infinite consumption.
